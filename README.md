# Robotic-Car

Surveillance can be used to estimate the magnitude of specific problems, determine the
distribution of obstacles, generate hypotheses, stimulate research, evaluate control measures,
monitor changes, and facilitate planning.
Robotic evolution starts with some basic ideas. It minimizes human efforts and it can be
deployed in a lot of fields like military, surveillance applications, Industrial Pick and Place
Robots latest Humanoid robots are developed in the modern world. Nowadays robotic cars
are developed by using Wireless technology. Wireless technology in Robotics starts with
Bluetooth, WI-FI, and Zigbee Communication. Based on the Requirement and Application
they deployed the communication in Projects. By using Wi-Fi technology, we can connect a
greater number of Robotic cars to control it very useful for surveillance applications. Nowadays Indoor localization Technologies are developed on that case also we can deploy this
type of Wi-Fi-controlled Robotic Car.
